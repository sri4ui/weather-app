# Weather Man - This App provides weather information based on user entered address. 
# How this App  works :

User can enter any  one value State, City , Zip and can the current weather at that location. Along with that we also have an option to look for weather conditions for whole week .

Based on the city, state, Zip entered we get the geolocation of the USER using google maps API and then call openweather API for current and future forecast.
